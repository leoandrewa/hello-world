Andrew here. It is March 2020 and the outbreak of the COVID-19 (a form of Corona virus) has gone into a worldwide Pandemic. I'm in Manila, Philippines. We have been on lockdown since March 15, it is March 26 day 11. I want to make use of this time to re-learn Computer Science and programming. I miss working out and playing basketball. I was getting ready for camp in July.
